In this exercise, students learn how to construct a concept of time using
`setRecurring` so the ball can move on its own without needing to be interacted
with by the user again.

They will also use a tool written by someone else to create random default
properties when initiating the ball and also to wrap from one edge of the screen
to the other.

Challenge students to make two thousand balls simultaneously in order to
underscore the ineffectiveness of this strategy. This will lead us to the Class
and OOP.
